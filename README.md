Friend Finder
=======
A fullstack match making application using the Express package for Node.js!

This app uses Express to serve 2 static HTML files and 2 API routes to get and post data.

Note that data is not persistent, but rather stored in an object in friends.js for your current session.

Could not deploy to localhost:8080 correctly, so I made a video on the outcome.
